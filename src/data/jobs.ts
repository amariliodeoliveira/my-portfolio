      "I’m responsible for building scalable UI components with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, having applied CPC architecture in a delivered project to ensure separation of concerns. I build out responsive, accessible interfaces using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, integrating them with RESTful APIs to align frontend requirements with backend data contracts. I also handle backend tasks by developing and refining endpoints with Node.js and Nest.js to support new features. To ensure reliability, I maintain high code quality through Jest unit and integration testing, while staying active in sprint planning and documentation-first workflows for smooth async collaboration.",

      "I built responsive, scalable interfaces using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, leveraging modular architecture and reusable components for long-term maintainability. I also focused heavily on application performance, where I optimized SSR/SSG applications based on Lighthouse metrics to enhance SEO and reduce page load times. Furthermore, I spearheaded the adoption of daisyUI to develop a custom design system that unified styling across our platforms. State management was handled efficiently via Redux and useContext, while Next.js Route Handlers were used to integrate RESTful APIs for dynamic data operations. To wrap up the workflow, I followed CI/CD best practices with GitHub Actions and collaborated closely in an Agile (Kanban) environment to ensure high code quality and reliable deployments.",
